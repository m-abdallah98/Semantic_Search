# Semantic_Search
#### Searching with semantic similarity between phrases
Semantic Search is a search technique that uses NLP to understand the meaning of words and phrases in a query and retrieve more relevant results. This method is helpful in articles, where it presents the most relevant articles to the user based on their search query. 

The process involves extracting useful meanings from the query and article content using techniques like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and text classification or with the aid of DL transformers which are very helpful in understanding the context of the phrases. 

A ranking algorithm is then used to score the relevance of articles to the query, and the most relevant articles are presented to the user.

Extracting hot keywords from articles involves identifying the most frequently occurring and relevant words or phrases in the text.
